# Mulri Step Form

This is a responsive Multi Step Form page that I developed using React, Sass, and Typescript to keep improving my frontend skils.
I also used LocalStorage to save data witch will clean up after to update the last page. 

Here is the link of my online project: [Multi Step Form](https://fascinating-scone-dd0c73.netlify.app/).
